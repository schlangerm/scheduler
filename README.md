scheduler software

how to use
- install python
- open your terminal of choice
- python main.py
      OR
- python3 main.py


where to start? 
- i started with the gui because that's where the inputs are coming from.
- my general idea is: gui inputs -> save file with profile -> load into processing component -> data is used to determine schedule
- check out gui/gui.py and gui/basewindow.py for ideas on where to start
- or dream big and start making the logical components, im open to any ideas
- I don't know what the best shape for the data is while transferring between these larger components, so I don't really care what shape the data comes out of the individual pieces yet, as that will all be redone anyway
